              <p>
                This is a tool I built as an experiment while learning javascript.
                It tracks when a user commits code and then counts the number of commits per day.
                There wasn't really a purpose to it, other than teaching myself javascript.
              </p>
              <p>The Github users were chosen from this <a href="https://gist.github.com/paulmillr/2657075/">list</a>, which I
                found by Googling "active github users." This is the
                first thing that I've built with Javascript and I
                just wanted to challenge myself in a fun way.
                Don't look too much into it.
              </p>
