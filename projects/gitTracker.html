              <p>
                This is a tool I built as an experiment while learning javascript.
                It tracks when a user commits code and then counts the number of commits per day.
                There wasn't really a purpose to it, other than teaching myself javascript.
              </p>
              <p>The Github users were chosen from this <a href="https://gist.github.com/paulmillr/2657075/">list</a>, which I
                found by Googling "active github users." This is the
                first thing that I've built with Javascript and I
                just wanted to challenge myself in a fun way.
                Don't look too much into it.
              </p>
              <h3>So how'd I do it?</h3>
              <p>(tl&#59;dr view the <a href="https://github.com/jbabrams2/gitTracker">Github repo here</a>)</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>I created an ajax call to the Github API, selecting a specific user's data.</li>
                  <li>If I successfully connected, I created a function that stored the returned data.</li>
                  <li>I used a for() loop that would loop through every result</li>
                  <li>I assigned the API value: "pushed_at" to a "pushed_at" variable</li>
                  <li>
                    I eliminated any text in the string that came after the date and assigned it to variable &quot;datePushed&quot;.
                    &quot;pushed_at&quot; was updated any time a commit was pushed to any of the repository's branches.
                  </li>
                  <li>I created a variable named "count", to store the number of times the user pushes code on a each date.</li>
                  <li>I nested another for() loop that would run through the length of the current data stored in the &quot;result&quot; paremeter.</li>
                  <li>I assigned the API value &quot;pushed_at&quot; to &quot;Match_pushed_at&quot; variable.</li>
                  <li>I again eliminated any text in the string that came after the date and assigned the result to the variable &quot;datePushed&quote;</li>
                  <li>I used an if() statement to determine whether the value of loop 1 was equal to the value of loop 2.
                    If the value was equal, it meant the user pushed code on that date more than once. I would then increment the &quot;count&quot; variable.</li>
                  <li>After running through every piece of data stored in the &quot;result&quot; parameter, an if() statement would run inside the first loop.</li>
                  <li> This statement checked if the &quot;datePushed&quot; had already been stored in the array named &quot;arr1&quot; (more on that later).
                    If so, it was a duplicate. I needed to count duplicates to sum the number of pushes on the given date, but I didn't want each date to
                    display to the user.
                  </li>
                  <li>Therefore, duplicates were not added to the array named &quot;match&quot;. Later in the script, I append text to the #pushList element ID based on
                    the values stored in &quot;match&quot;.
                  <li>
                    Further, if the value in &quot;datePushed&quot; was not a duplicate, I would store the &quot;count&quot; value in another array named, &quot;arr2&quot;.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Next, every single &quot;datePushed&quot; value in the loop was added to the &quot;arr1&quot; array so that the above if() statement could properly
                    cross-check whether any future &quot;datePushed&quot; values were duplicates.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    I then created yet another for() loop which looped through the &quot;match&quot; array and appended the relevant HTML
                    to the HTML element with the &quot;pushList1&quot; ID.
                  </li>
                  <li>Finally, I used an if() statement to use plural language if the user pushed code more than once on a given date.</li>
                  <li>I repeated this process for a total of three different Github users, generating the results of each user in their own column.</li>
                  <li>That's it!</li>
                </ol>
                <p>I'm certain there is a more efficient way for me to structure this script, but I wrote this after just starting to learn Javascript.
                  In fact, if you look carefully, you'll see that each user usually pushed code only once per date (though they occassionally pushed more often).
                  This has led me to speculate that there's an error in my code somewhere.
                 I may go back one day to find the bug (if there is one) and optimize the script. For now though, that's it!</p>
