          <h2>UINightlife.com (2010 - 2011)</h2>
          <p>
            UINightlife was a website I launched with
            <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjz34r0t9LKAhVE-GMKHSQzCn4QFggiMAE&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fin%2Fstevezazeski&usg=AFQjCNEguuHBIjz7gvkDIFQY8Z0OUd9ZDA&sig2=UJODlTBjHkJVMXaByJ0W-A">Steve Zazeski</a>
            and <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0ahUKEwj1xPflt9LKAhUP2GMKHcmtBJkQFggdMAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fin%2Fmichael-candido-9b7a5330&usg=AFQjCNEwyL1VLWNWCWaaqp6TFgmSPXbpPw&sig2=oXjg0jGjES9ry-DbjrK4NQ">Michael Candido</a>.

            The purpose was to help students make the most informed decision when deciding on their weekend activities. Before UINightlife, students chose a bar at random, or based on general vibes. After UINightlife, students could check which bars had the best drinks and specials on any given night.
          </p>
          <p>
          We also setup a line-cam to show students which bars would be the busiest and which would be dead.
          </p>
          <p>
            After being covered by the student newspaper and a local television station, traffic spiked and we leveraged it to gain partnerships with bars throughout campus. Our two closest partnerships were with Brothers Bar and Legends Bar and Grill.
          </p>
          <p>
            We closed the site after graduating.

            Below, I have attached various screenshots of the website.
