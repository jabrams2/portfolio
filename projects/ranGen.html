            While I was digging into Github's API for GitTracker, I decided to build a repo discovery app.</p>
          <p>
            On load, the app would randomly select a Github user and four of their repositories. If you wanted to keep exploring, you could click a button to reload the repos.
          </p>
          <p>
            Just like with GitTracker, my only purpose in building this app was to explore Javascript and Github's API. It was a fun project.
          </p>
