            This is an ongoing project to renovate <a href="autofxusa.com">AutoFXUSA.com</a>
            AutoFX is an automotive reconditioning solution company that is seeking to expand its online presence.

            Since the project is ongoing, the source code is confidential and the repo is private.</a>

            Below is a screencast and sample screenshots from an early design that I offered. The client rejected this design in favor of an alternative, which I will post here when the site is live.
