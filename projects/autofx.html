          <p>
            This is an ongoing project to renovate <a href="autofxusa.com">AutoFXUSA.com</a>
            AutoFX is an automotive reconditioning solution company that is seeking to expand its online presence.

          <p>
            Since the project is ongoing, the source code is confidential and the repo is private.</a>

            Below is a screencast and sample screenshots from an early design that I offered. The client rejected this design in favor of an alternative, which I will post here when the site is live.
          </p>
          <h3>Early mockup of the landing page</h3>
          <img src="{{" /assets/images/autofx-mock.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="" />
          <h3>Early mockup of the Dealership section of the landing page</h3>
          <img src="{{" /assets/images/autofx-mock2.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="" />
          <h3>Test of early iteration's nav</h3>
          <p>
            The scroll was still a little jumpy, but you can see that the bottom-nav fixes to the top of the view after you scroll past it
